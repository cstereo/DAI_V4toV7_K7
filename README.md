# DAI V4toV7 K7


## DAI vintage computer cassette input upgrade 
This module enables early DAI versions, a vintage computer from Data Application International, 
to have their cassette input behave like the latest versions, which are more performant. 
It notably allows old DAI versions to read faster “optimized wav” files such as those generated with the DGV program. 

DO NOT MODIFY A DAI UNLESS YOU PERFECTLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 
THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR YOU OR FOR THE DAI.


## Schemes and Simulations
Due to copyright restrictions, simulation will not work.
You need to download components spice files from the internet (easy if you know Kicad)
